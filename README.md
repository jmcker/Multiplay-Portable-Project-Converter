# Multiplay Portable Project Converter #

Converts Multiplay projects that depend on local audio files into portable, self-contained projects. All necessary files are copied into a project folder, which can be moved to and used in a different directory or on a seperate backup machine.
v1.1

This tool greatly improves on the idea of Multiplay's *Archive* function.
